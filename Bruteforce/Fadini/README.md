Play the single file (16384/ folder) to make sure the attack works

Play the two files inside 8192/ folder, to see which half contains the correct key (suppose the second one works, 000_001.sub containing keys from 4096 8191)

Play its children (001_002.sub, 001_003.sub) inside the 4096/ folder to narrow the search

Keep doing this until you reach the last files inside the 128/ folder, these files take less than 10 seconds to send, almost the same as having the actual remote.
